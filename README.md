PIZZA SALES REPORT (MICROSOFT POWER BI PROJECT) 

In this project, I imported the dataset and undertook the tasks of data importing, data cleaning, data transformation, and dashboard building in Microsoft Power BI. I evaluated the busiest times, sales performance, best sellers, and worst sellers to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction in the pizza business.

âš™ Approach Followed:

ðŸ”¸ Import Data in Microsoft Power BI   

ðŸ”¸ Data Cleaning using Power Query

ðŸ”¸ KPI's Building

ðŸ”¸ Data Processing

ðŸ”¸ Building Daily and Monthly Trend Charts

ðŸ”¸ Building % of Sales by Category and Size

ðŸ”¸ Adding Insights

ðŸ”¸ Add Navigator Buttons

ðŸ”Ž Insights:

ðŸ”¹ Orders are highest on Thursdays (15.17%), Fridays (16.57%), and Saturdays (14.79%)

ðŸ”¹ The maximum number of orders occurs in the months of January (8.64%), May (8.68%), and July (9.06%)

ðŸ”¹ Classic category contributes the most to quantities (30.03%) and sales (26.91%)

ðŸ”¹ Large-sized pizza contributes to maximum sales (45.89%)

ðŸ”¹ The Classic Deluxe pizza is the most popular choice, accounting for the highest number of orders (4.92%) and quantities sold (4.95%)

ðŸ”¹ The Thai Chicken pizza generates the highest revenue (5.31%)

ðŸ”¹ The Brie Carre pizza is among the least ordered items (1.01%) with lower quantities sold (0.99%) and resulting in relatively lower revenue (1.42%)

ðŸ“Š Conclusion:

Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays are the busiest days, likely due to the weekend preference. January, May, and July have the most orders, possibly due to seasonal factors. Classic pizzas are the most popular, driving sales. Large-sized pizzas make up almost half of revenue. The customer favourite is Classic Deluxe, with the highest orders and sales. These insights are valuable for optimizing pizza offerings and marketing strategies.
