PIZZA SALES REPORT (MICROSOFT POWER BI PROJECT) 

In this project, I imported the dataset and undertook the tasks of data importing, data cleaning, data transformation, and dashboard building in Microsoft Power BI. I evaluated the busiest times, sales performance, best sellers, and worst sellers to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction in the pizza business.

⚙️ Steps Followed:

🔸 **Data Importing**: Imported a dataset into Microsoft Power BI, which is the initial step in any data analysis project. 

🔸 **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the dataset using Power Query tool, ensuring data quality by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any other data inconsistencies.

🔸 **Data Transformation**: Used DAX Functions to get custom columns into the report. I also undertook tasks like aggregating data, creating calculated columns, or performing other data manipulations to make it suitable for analysis.

🔸 **Data Visualization**: Built a dashboard in Microsoft Power BI, which serves as a visual representation of my analysis. Dashboards are excellent for presenting insights in a user-friendly manner.
