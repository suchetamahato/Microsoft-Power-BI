PIZZA SALES REPORT (MICROSOFT POWER BI PROJECT) 

In this project, I imported the dataset and undertook the tasks of data importing, data cleaning, data transformation, and dashboard building in Microsoft Power BI. I evaluated the busiest times, sales performance, best sellers, and worst sellers to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction in the pizza business.

⚙️ Steps Followed:

🔸Data Importing: Imported a dataset into Microsoft Power BI, which is the initial step in any data analysis project. 

🔸Data Cleaning: Cleaned the dataset using Power Query tool, ensuring data quality by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any other data inconsistencies.

🔸Data Transformation: Used DAX Functions to get Custom columns into the report. I also did tasks like aggregating data, creating calculated columns, or performing other data manipulations
to make it suitable for analysis.

🔸Data Visualization: Built a dashboard in Microsoft Power BI, which serves as a visual representation of my analysis. Dashboards are excellent for presenting insights in a user-friendly manner.

🔎 Insights:

🔹 Orders are highest on Thursdays (15.17%), Fridays (16.57%), and Saturdays (14.79%)

🔹 The maximum number of orders occurs in the months of January (8.64%), May (8.68%), and July (9.06%)

🔹 Classic category contributes the most to quantities (30.03%) and sales (26.91%)

🔹 Large-sized pizza contributes to maximum sales (45.89%)

🔹 The Classic Deluxe pizza is the most popular choice, accounting for the highest number of orders (4.92%) and quantities sold (4.95%)

🔹 The Thai Chicken pizza generates the highest revenue (5.31%)

🔹 The Brie Carre pizza is among the least ordered items (1.01%) with lower quantities sold (0.99%) and resulting in relatively lower revenue (1.42%)

📊 Conclusion:

Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays are the busiest days, likely due to the weekend preference. January, May, and July have the most orders, possibly due to seasonal factors. Classic pizzas are the most popular, driving sales. Large-sized pizzas make up almost half of revenue. The customer favourite is Classic Deluxe, with the highest orders and sales. These insights are valuable for optimizing pizza offerings and marketing strategies.
