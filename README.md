PIZZA SALES DATA ANALYSIS USING MICROSOFT POWER BI 

In this project, I imported the dataset and undertook the tasks of data importing, data cleaning, data transformation, and dashboard building in Microsoft Power BI. I evaluated the busiest times, sales performance, best sellers, and worst sellers to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction in the pizza business.

âš™ Approach Followed:

- Import Data in Microsoft Power BI   


- Data Cleaning using Power Query


- KPI's Building


- Data Processing


- Building Daily and Monthly Trend Charts


- Building % of Sales by Category and Size


- Adding Insights


- Add Navigator Buttons

ðŸ”Ž Insights:

- Orders are highest on Thursdays (15.17%), Fridays (16.57%), and Saturdays (14.79%)

- The maximum number of orders occurs in the months of January (8.64%), May (8.68%), and July (9.06%)

- Classic category contributes the most to quantities (30.03%) and sales (26.91%)

- Large-sized pizza contributes to maximum sales (45.89%)

- The Classic Deluxe pizza is the most popular choice, accounting for the highest number of orders (4.92%) and quantities sold (4.95%)

- The Thai Chicken pizza generates the highest revenue (5.31%)

- The Brie Carre pizza is among the least ordered items (1.01%) with lower quantities sold (0.99%) and resulting in relatively lower revenue (1.42%)

ðŸ“Š Conclusion:

Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays emerge as the busiest days, suggesting a preference for weekend indulgence. Additionally, the months of January, May, and July witness the highest number of orders, possibly due to seasonal factors. The Classic category stands out as the top contributor to both quantities and sales, indicating its widespread popularity among customers. Moreover, the preference for large-sized pizzas significantly influences overall sales, constituting nearly half of the revenue. Notably, the Classic Deluxe pizza emerges as the customers' favourite, leading in both order frequency and quantities sold. These findings provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making and marketing efforts to further optimize the pizza offerings and capitalize on customer preferences.
