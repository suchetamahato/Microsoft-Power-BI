PIZZA SALES DATA ANALYSIS USING MICROSOFT POWER BI

In this project, I imported the dataset and undertook the tasks of data importing, data cleaning, data transformation, and dashboard building in Microsoft Power BI. I evaluated the busiest times, sales performance, best sellers, and worst sellers to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction in the pizza business.

pproach:

✔ KPIs to know whether the company is achieving its objective or not.
✔ The cumulative total of sales to understand the growth of the business.
✔ The inventory management of different stores.
✔ Finding out the special days and seasons during which sales are high.

✔ Power query- To find distinct values as well as the range and presence of missing values.
✔ Data modeling – To manage relationships between tables.
✔ Dax function- For creating KPIs, financial formulae, calculated columns, and measures.
✔ Tooltips – To look at the performance of a product in terms of its sales and inventory.
✔ Visualizations – To create interactive dashboards.

✔ Analysis of the information in hand (about the variables) in Excel first.
✔ Presence of erroneous values of missing points.
✔ Creation of a date table to perform time intelligence functions.
✔ Data modeling and management of relationships (especially of the newly created table with others.)
✔ DAX functions – for profit, sales, running total, and usage of KPIs.

✔ Company met its target (sales- 545.84K, Profit- 133.26K)
✔ The highest sales were witnessed by the product category of Toys and were the least for Arts and crafts.
✔ Highest sales were observed between the first and the second quarter of both years.
✔ More stores can be opened at Durango as it is showing a high-profit margin.
✔ Overall profit margin is 21.79% which is quite good. (As 10% is optimum for any company)

INSIGHTS:

- Orders are highest on Thursdays (15.17%), Fridays (16.57%), and Saturdays (14.79%)

- The maximum number of orders occurs in the months of January (8.64%), May (8.68%), and July (9.06%)

- Classic category contributes the most to quantities (30.03%) and sales (26.91%)

- Large-sized pizza contributes to maximum sales (45.89%)

- The Classic Deluxe pizza is the most popular choice, accounting for the highest number of orders (4.92%) and quantities sold (4.95%)

- The Thai Chicken pizza generates the highest revenue (5.31%)

- The Brie Carre pizza is among the least ordered items (1.01%) with lower quantities sold (0.99%) and resulting in relatively lower revenue (1.42%)

CONCLUSION:

Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays emerge as the busiest days, suggesting a preference for weekend indulgence. Additionally, the months of January, May, and July witness the highest number of orders, possibly due to seasonal factors. The Classic category stands out as the top contributor to both quantities and sales, indicating its widespread popularity among customers. Moreover, the preference for large-sized pizzas significantly influences overall sales, constituting nearly half of the revenue. Notably, the Classic Deluxe pizza emerges as the customers' favorite, leading in both order frequency and quantities sold. These findings provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making and marketing efforts to further optimize the pizza offerings and capitalize on customer preferences.
