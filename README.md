# PIZZA SALES REPORT (MICROSOFT POWER BI PROJECT) 

In this project, I used Microsoft Power BI to import, clean, transform data, and create a dashboard.

# Steps Followed

ðŸ”¸ **Data Importing**

I imported a dataset into Microsoft Power BI, which is the initial step in any data analysis project. 

ðŸ”¸ **Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset using Power Query tool, ensuring data quality by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any other data inconsistencies.

ðŸ”¸ **Data Transformation**

I used DAX Functions to get custom columns into the report. I also undertook tasks like aggregating data, creating calculated columns, or performing other data manipulations to make it suitable for analysis.

ðŸ”¸ **Data Visualization**

I built a dashboard in Microsoft Power BI, which serves as a visual representation of my analysis. Dashboards are excellent for presenting insights in a user-friendly manner.
