PIZZA SALES DATA ANALYSIS USING MICROSOFT POWER BI 

In this project, I imported the dataset and undertook the tasks of data importing, data cleaning, data transformation, and dashboard building in Microsoft Power BI. I evaluated the busiest times, sales performance, best sellers, and worst sellers to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction in the pizza business.

âš™ Approach Followed:

- Import Data in Microsoft Power BI

ðŸ”Ž Insights:

- Orders are highest on Thursdays (15.17%), Fridays (16.57%), and Saturdays (14.79%)

- The maximum number of orders occurs in the months of January (8.64%), May (8.68%), and July (9.06%)

- Classic category contributes the most to quantities (30.03%) and sales (26.91%)

- Large-sized pizza contributes to maximum sales (45.89%)

- The Classic Deluxe pizza is the most popular choice, accounting for the highest number of orders (4.92%) and quantities sold (4.95%)

- The Brie Carre pizza is among the least ordered items (1.01%) with lower quantities sold (0.99%) and resulting in relatively lower revenue (1.42%)

ðŸ“Š Conclusion:

Busiest days are Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, with a weekend preference. Top-order months: January, May, and July, likely due to seasons. Classic category is popular, especially Classic Deluxe. Large pizzas drive half of revenue. Insights for better pizza offerings and marketing.
